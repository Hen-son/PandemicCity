## Introduction


Health threats related to infectious diseases have received considerable attention recently and are again registered as problems of national security in most Western nations [@Feldbaum10Global]. Several occurrences of an epidemic spread of infectious pathogens such as H5NI in 2001, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009 or the recent Ebola crisis in 2014 served as evidence for the threat of “The Coming Plague” [@Garrett94Coming]. 

Critical scholarship in international relations research, public health and security studies pointed out how this perception of health threats has formed into a so called ‘emerging diseases worldview’ [@King02Security]. A range of works shows how this thinking did alter the regulatory framework of international infection control [@Fidler04SARS], the paradigms of Global Health [@Ingram05New; @Huang09Flew; @Weir10Global; @Hoffman10evolutiona] and how this threat discourse contributed to the establishment of a pre-emptive approach in national security provision [@Cooper06Contagious; @Thacker05Living; @Lakoff08Population; @Elbe10Security]. As critical research demonstrates, an ‘emerging diseases worldview‘ has been influential in shaping policies at several scales.

Less approached from a critical perspective is how an ’emerging diseases worldview’ is changing paradigms and measures of infection control on an urban scale. Global cities are singled out both as the incubators as well as the facilitators of transmission in current threat discourses and measures of infection control in cities have received renewed attention. Especially after the SARS events in 2003, a range of case studies evaluated the intensified public health regimes in some of the mostly affected cities [@Loh04epicentre; Sanford05New; James06Public] and the WHO underlined the key role of city authorities in mitigating a future pandemic [@WHO09Cities].

Still, those research is mostly oriented towards a policy evaluation. Research on broader urban aspects of emerging infectious disease is still scarce [@Wolf09Zoonoses; @Brown092008]. Roger Keil and Harris Ali pioneered work in this direction. As they argue, renewed measures of infection control do change the constellations of urban governance, the everyday life in the cities and they demand to rethink fundamental concepts of urban studies such as nature/society dichotomy or the hierarchy of global and city level. “[T]he potential reemergence of infectious disease at a mass scale forces us to rethink the relationship of our built environments, our institutional arrangements and our practices as urban dwellers based on the ways cities deal with emerging infections.“ [@Keil07Governing, 854]. Several facets of this rethinking have been detailed in a subsequent collection [@Ali09Networked] and related works [@Hoffman13return]. 
 
One important question concerns the changing biopolitics of the ‘pandemic city‘. The city as a tool to form the needed “medico-administrative“ knowledge about the population as well as a site of exerting influence on the daily habits of its inhabitants had always a pivotal function in Michel Foucaults analysis of biopolitics [@Foucautl14politics]. The intention of political power to act upon the relations of human beings - insofar as they are a species - and their environments is one of the characteristic traits of biopolitics. The ‘urban problem‘, that is the intersection of man-made environments and populations and the regulation of this intersection is therefore an essential biopolitical question [@Foucault03Society, 246].

it does involve interrogating the ways in which un/healthy populations are rendered visible or knowable to policy-makers and the devices, mechanisms, practices, and strategies that are used to “encourage” individuals to make healthy choices.

Bi members  Michel Foucault has famously shown, both individual bodies and the collective body of the population have become an increasingly important object of political power throughout the . With biopolitics he marks the shift towards an  collective well-being  of a power that I would call the power of regularization, and it, in contrast, consists in making live and letting die.“ (247)    object of political power has shifted   problematization of the health of the population and the  Public Health interventions  and   an intensified urban infection control

In the following I am interested in the effect of an ‘emerging diseases world view’ on local public health practices. I claim that effects of securitization are also to be found beyond the changing structures and modes of Global Health governance and in the way everyday interactions are governed. The shift towards Global Health Security is connected to changes in the modalities and techniques of governing un/healthy bodies ‘on the ground’.



 based on the  a  some work into planning aspects of infectious disease preparedness and pointed out urban governance aspects of emerging infectious diseases [@Keil07Governing; Ali08Networked]. 


Throughout history, urban environments have been one of the crucial areas of intervention against infectious diseases. Urban space often constituted the field of operation for infection control and sometimes became also its main target. Banning sick people from town to isolate the healthy inhabitants is a documented practice from ancient times onwards and the 19th century’s ‚bacteriological city‘ saw vast investments into infrastructures of sanitation and public hygiene [@Gandy06Bacteriological]. 
Today, urban areas are again singled out as especially dangerous in pandemic scenarios. The probability of dissemination is said to be higher in urban areas simply because of the population density and a higher frequency of contact. Furthermore, cities become depicted as important nodal points facilitating the intensifying global interconnection (Ali and Keil 2007) and at the same time as sites of increasingly vulnerable inhabitants (Ravallion et al., 2007). The ongoing migration of a rural poor into the cities and an overall growing inequality leads towards an increasing number of people in the city deprived of healthy living conditions and nutrition (Razum and Voigtländer 2010). Taking together, the city scale is registered as especially problematic in the current discourse on emerging diseases [@Rodwin02World; WHO09Cities]. the threat of a globally emerging pandemic derives its plausibility in part from the fact of increasingly dense connections, ongoing exchanges and rapid travel between the major urban centers of the world. 
Accordingly, the urban scale is targeted again as the predominant site for measures of infection control, surveillance and prevention.

Against this backdrop I want to examine current practices of infection control at the intersection of bodies and power. My goal here is to better identify the current public health regime connected with an ‘emerging diseases worldview’ and how it is played out ‘on the ground’.
