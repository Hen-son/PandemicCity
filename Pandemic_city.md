## Pandemic City

The current discourse on the threat of infectious disease recalls on the contagiousness of cities prominent in the sanitary discourse of the 19th century (Armstrong 1996, Wald 2008). 

%%„There is ample scholarship on the historical relationship between municipal government and disease both historically and on recent developments, such as the reemergence of TB, the role of urban poverty and diversity vis-a`-vis disease or the ravages of AIDS (see, for example, Craddock 2000; Gandy and Zumla 2003; Raphael 2004; Shah 1997).“ [@Keil97Governing, 851]


Often the city as the centre of population, trade and interaction has been targeted as the predominant site for public health interventions. The city’s proximity of rich and poor has fueled fears of promiscuity [@Stallybrass86Politics]. Fears that then played out in hygiene measures and the cleaning of spaces. Urban space often constitutes the field of operation for infection control and sometimes becomes also the main target of those interventions.


Until today, the SARS crisis serves as a prime example of the emerging diseases problematic and provides an important reference for proponents of the intensification of biosecurity efforts and infection control. SARS spread in 2003 especially in Toronto and Hong Kong. In both cities, extraordinary measures of infection control where employed at the time of acute disease.
In Hong Kong, the experience of SARS did initiate a significant change of local politics in the aftermath. The institutions of public health had been restructured, new technologies such as monitoring systems and new regulations of infection control had been employed. Hong Kong in the aftermath of SARS can be expected to be in many regards as an edge case for how infection control is reorganized locally under an ‘emerging diseases worldview’ and is well suited to bring out current coping strategies clearly.

As Bruce Braun argues, “SARS revealed the city to be an intensely biopolitial space” and he wonders, if and how “the geographic and political rationalities of the biopolitical city” (Braun 2008, 252) are reworked through the emerging disease discourse. Public health interventions in Hong Kong after the SARS crisis may allow to dissect the form and nature of ongoing biopolitical interventions on an urban scale under the credo of an ‘emerging diseases worldview’.
